                    <li>
                        The hottest planet in our solar system is Venus, with
                        surface temperatures reaching over 450°C (842°F).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand
                        on all the beaches of Earth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A day on Venus is longer than a year due to its slow
                        rotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Jupiter has the most moons in our solar system, with
                        over 90 confirmed moons orbiting the gas giant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Light from the Sun takes approximately 8 minutes and 20
                        seconds to reach Earth.

                    <li>
                        Black holes are regions in space where gravity is so
                        strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Saturn is famous for its stunning ring system, which is
                        composed of ice, rock, and dust particles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The largest volcano in the solar system is Olympus Mons,
                        located on Mars. It is about 13.6 miles (22 kilometers)
                        high!

                <h2>Space Exploration</h2>
                <p>
                    Humans have been exploring space for decades. The first
                    human-made object to reach space was the V-2 rocket launched
                    by Germany in 1944. Later, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1
                    became the first artificial satellite in 1957.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1969, NASA's Apollo 11 mission made history when Neil
                    Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to walk on
                    the Moon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Today, space agencies around the world continue to push the
                    boundaries of exploration, from sending rovers to Mars to
                    studying distant galaxies using advanced telescopes like the
                    James Webb Space Telescope.

                <h2>Expanding Universe</h2>
                <p>
                    The mysteries of space continue to inspire scientists and
                    dreamers alike. Did you know that the universe is still
                    expanding? This discovery, made in the 20th century,
                    reshaped our understanding of cosmology.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some scientists believe that the universe might expand
                    forever, while others think it could eventually collapse
                    back on itself in a "Big Crunch." Either way, the study of
                    the cosmos helps us understand our place in it.
